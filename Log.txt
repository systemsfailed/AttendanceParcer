there are so many bugs in that program 1:40pm, Tues, Feb 2, 2016 by MichaelKrill
is using student(first, last) more efficient than the constructor before it? 1:40pm, Tues, Feb 2, 2016 by Alcasid
There is no ; because she wants to debug it later 1:40pm, Tues, Feb 2, 2016 by nicoleWallack
If you were here last class, she's basically copying the code she did last time. 1:40pm, Tues, Feb 2, 2016 by sebastianAracena

setters assign a value to something, getters return it 1:44pm, Tues, Feb 2, 2016 by artemYeremeyev
Getters return values 1:44pm, Tues, Feb 2, 2016 by NicholasCholovskiy
It's a way to get and change the values of private variables from an outside class 1:45pm, Tues, Feb 2, 2016 by sebastianAracena
setters assign value 1:45pm, Tues, Feb 2, 2016 by marieGiebelhouse
